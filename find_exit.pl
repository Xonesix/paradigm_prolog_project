/*
Ok we need coordinates

so i guess it would be like coord(X,Y) something like that

then maybe a move function.
That will move the coordinates, if it's not a wall etc. etc.

/*
The coordinates must start at the start coordinate
So find a value that has [s] in it i guess

WAIT A MINUTE THIS IS JSUT DFS IN PROLOG

IF I CAN IMPLEMENT DFS INTO PROLOG AND STOP WHEN I FIND THE EXIT
AND BACKTRACK THE COORDINATES I CAN SOLVE THE MAZE
i need to figure out how to do DFS
