# Prolog Project

- Notes
- I just finished reading like half the chapter on prolog and i think i got the gist of it,
- i think i want to start a test prolog project using some examples before i start coding up the main thing


## 12:38 PM
- I tried some basic prolog it seemd to work
- Now I guess I'll try to start the project

## 12:48 PM
- I added some other file for the project and I can see that the test file provides a way to create a made and example.pl displays the maze in a different way. 
- OK, now I need to create a function that traverses the mazE
- My first idea is to see what kind of rules I would need
- I think it would be like If left is blocked, go right
- If right blocked go up.
- Repeat until maze solved?
- Totally brute force but i don't have that much time and it should solve it for me
